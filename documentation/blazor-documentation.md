## What is Blazor?
Blazor is an open source .NET framework for building dynamic and interactive frontends for your applications with HTML, C#, and Razor templates. Blazor allows you to compose components directly for your server or for the client-side. This flexibility enables developers to create fullstack web and mobile applications with a single-page UI framework.

Typically, most frontend frameworks use JavaScript under the hood but with Blazor, you can build both frontends and backends with C#. Developers who are well versed in C# can easily build fullstack applications without switching to a different framework.  

## Companies using Blazor
More companies are adopting Blazor into their development workflows because a developer can write client-side and server-side logic with only C# and .NET. Some examples include  GE Aviation, BurnRate, The Postage, and Pernod Ricard. 

Blazor provides all the scaffolding, abstractions, tooling and optimizations you need on a project. 

In this guide you will learn how to build a new Blazor Project, and how to integrate Flowbite components into your application. We'll use a modal component for this exercise to demonstrate a real use case. 

You'll need to install and configure Tailwind CSS, Bloazor and Flowbite into your application. Let's get started!
